## Background and motivation

A recurring topic when talking about COVID-19 is that comparing numbers from multiple countries on a given day is such a bad indicator of how well/poorly those countries are doing compared to each other that it’s basically pointless. Which also makes it very easy to cherry pick data to support your own point of view, which helps our beloved politicians create fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

The 7-day moving average of new coronavirus-related deaths per one million inhabitants is an indicator which is very difficult to tinker with, it’s proportional to the population, and due to the moving average the curves are smoother, so it’s easier to see the trends. It’s also easy to see how selected countries are doing now compared to their respective first waves.
